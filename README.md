# `valid_move?` for Tic Tac Toe

## Overview

When we take a user's move in Tic Tac Toe we first have to validate that the move obeys the rules of the game.

1. You must move to a position within the tic tac toe board.
2. The position must be vacant and not currently taken by a player.

Build a simple method `valid_move?` that accepts a board and a position to check and returns true if the move is valid and false if not.

You can implement a `position_taken?` method to simplify the code in `valid_move?`.

## Objectives

1. Use either `if` statements of boolean expressions.
2. Use another method to make your code more readable.
